# Unlister
Unlister is a simple script for Mail on macOS that scans your Junk mailbox for promotional emails and newsletter and automatically unsubscribes from them.

It searches for the [List-Unsubscribe](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2369.txt) header and then presents you a list of subscriptions. After you choose the ones you want to opt-out of, the script will automatically load the unsubscribe page or send the unsubscribe email in the background.

## How to run the script
1. Click [this link](http://www.gvdev.com/unlister) to open the source in Script Editor.
2. Press Run (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>).
